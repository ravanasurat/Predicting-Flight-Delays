# Predicting-Flight-Delays
Predicting Flight Delays - Big Data , Pyspark

Task 1:

Focus on manipulating data using Spark RDD, Spark DataFrames and Spark SQL
•	Part 1: Work with RDDs in PySpark to implement specific queries related to flight delays data analysis.
•	Part 2: Work with Dataframes in PySpark to implement specific queries related to flight delays data analysis.
•	Part 3: Implement a query and compare three different approaches: RDD, DataFrame, and SparkSQL.



Task 2 & 3- Part A: Preprocessing, Visualization, Data Modelling


Use Spark DataFrames, Spark SQL, MLlib/ML packages to do the pre-processing, visualization, and data modelling steps. The data modelling task aims to create the machine learning models utilizing MLlib/ML APIs to predict both departure and arrival delays from the testing data using classification tasks. Build models to predict the classes.
•	Part 1: Data Loading, Cleaning, Labelling, and Exploration
•	Part 2: Feature extraction and ML Training




Task 4 & 5 - Part A: Real-time stream processing on big data

Simulate the streaming data production using Kafka, then show some basic streaming classification to display the prediction accuracy and total number of flight records after consuming the data. Build a streaming application that integrates the machine learning model that can classify the flight-delays data stream.
•	Task 1: Kafka Producer - Producing the streaming data, where you can use csv modules to read and publish the data to the Kafka stream.
•	Task 2: Kafka Consumer - Consuming the streaming data using Kafka consumer, process and visualize the ingested data from Kafka.
•	Task 3: Streaming application - Using Spark Structured Streaming together with Spark ML/SQL to process data streams.
